# ByteToByte

ByteToByte is an in progress web application that allows developers to compare programming languages side-by-side. 
It provides syntax and method comparisons for common programming concepts like loops, conditionals, classes, and more. 
ByteToByte is designed for learners (like myself), to see how different languages tackle similar problems and any distinguishing features that I can find.

I am using this project as a means to introduce myself to the C#/.NET ecosystem, utilising languages I am currently already familiar with for comparison.
